# RISC-V CPU Implementation in Verilog

This project is a Verilog-based implementation of a RISC-V CPU, developed as part of the CSED311: Computer Architecture course at POSTECH. It includes several architectural designs, developed step-by-step to increase complexity and performance.

## Implemented Architectures

- ALU (Lab1)
- Single-Cycle CPU (Lab2)
- Multi-Cycle CPU (Lab3)
- Pipelined CPU (without control flow) (Lab4)
- Pipelined CPU (with control flow) (Lab4-2)
- Cache (for data and/or instructions) (Lab5)

## Tools 

- Verilog HDL
- Simulator: Verilator, Cygwin, GTKWave
- Instruction Set Architecture: RISC-V RV32I
